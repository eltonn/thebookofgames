## What kind of game reviews is accepted?

All games **ARE ELIGIBLE** for a review when they **DON'T**:

- promote any kind of discrimination
- have offensive materials or references
- encourage any dangerous acts in the real world

If you are not sure if the game you want to review is eligible for this community,
open an issue (at [The Book of Games Issues Page][thebookofgames-issues]) asking about that, providing information as much as possible.

## General rules

If you want to submit a propose for a new game review, ensure the following points:

- You have played a substantial part of the game. It is better if you have finished it first,
but if the game is very long, for example a game that needs more than 100 hours to be finished,
it is fine if you have played 30%-50% of the game. The important thing is that you have had
a good amount of knowledge and experience of game.
- Start your review using a template (`/docs/templates`) or an existent game review file as reference.
- The evaluation table is fixed and is divided in `general evaluation` and `specific evaluation`.
Check more information about that on section {ref}`content:evaluation-tables`.
- Ensure to add original text and images that don't have any license issue. Also, ensure to add
the credits and references to the any external material properly.
- Always add information about the company that developed the game and age restriction.

## Evaluation tables

Additionally, it should present the {ref}`content:evaluation-table-general` table,
that is a common criteria shared among all game category.

In general, all the evaluation items are in the range of 0 to 5 stars, when `0 star` means that the
item was evaluated as a very bad or inexistent item and 5 stars means that the item was evaluated as
`excelent`.
